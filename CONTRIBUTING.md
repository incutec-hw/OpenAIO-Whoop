# Contributing

## Setup

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/incutec-hw/OpenAIO-Whoop.git
```

The `--recursive` flag pulls the `libs/KiCad-Library` submodule, which the project lib tables reference for shared parts. Use KiCad 10.

## Workflow

- `main` is protected. Work on a feature branch and open a pull request.
- Edit schematics and the PCB in KiCad only. Never text-edit `.kicad_sch`, `.kicad_pcb`, or other `.kicad_*` files.
- New shared parts (symbols, footprints, 3D models) go to [incutec-hw/KiCad-Library](https://github.com/incutec-hw/KiCad-Library) via PR there, not into this repo's local libraries.
- ERC and DRC must be clean before opening a PR:

```
kicad-cli sch erc --exit-code-violations hardware/OpenAIO-Whoop.kicad_sch
kicad-cli pcb drc --exit-code-violations hardware/OpenAIO-Whoop.kicad_pcb
```
