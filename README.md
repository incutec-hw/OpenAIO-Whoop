# OpenAIO-Whoop

Whoop-class variant forked from [OpenAIO](../OpenAIO). The design below is inherited verbatim from the toothpick-class parent and **has not yet been adapted for whoop class** — mounting pattern, current rating, and cell count still need revising.

Open-source AIO (flight controller + 4-in-1 ESC). _Inherited parent spec (TODO: revise for whoop):_ 25.5×25.5 mounting pattern, toothpick-class 6S, 30 A continuous per channel.

Built by combining three existing projects:

- **[OpenFC-ECO](https://github.com/Just4Stan/OpenFC-ECO)** — RP2354B flight controller stage (IMU, OSD, power, blackbox, USB-C)
- **[4in1ESC](https://github.com/Just4Stan/OpenESC)** — AT32F421 + NSG2065Q + SP40N03GNJ ESC stage, AM32 firmware
- **[OpenRX-Lite](https://github.com/Just4Stan/OpenRX)** — ESP32-C3 + SX1281 2.4 GHz ExpressLRS receiver

Physical construction: two PCBs reflowed together via BGA-style solder pad bonding. FC stage is the top board, ESC stage is the bottom daughterboard, both fabricated in the same KiCad project.

## Firmware targets (already merged upstream)

| Stage | Target |

## Known issues inherited from source designs

From OpenFC-ECO V0.3 — fix before first AIO spin:
- **C28** (22 µF 0603 16V on +10V rail): voltage rating too low — change to 25V
- **R30** (6.8k): gives 9.42V not 10V — change to 6.34k (E96)
- **L2** (4.7 µH): undersized for 10V rail at 6S — change to ~10 µH (FTC303020D100MBCA)
- **LED0** (D7, green): Betaflight manufacturer guidelines §3.1.4.6 **require** LED0 to be blue
- **Reverse-polarity protection**: not present in ECO, add for AIO
- **LMR51420** (2A): drop-in upgrade to LMR51430YFDDCR (3A)

From 4in1ESC 2 — supply chain notes in `ALTERNATIVES.md` and `COST_ANALYSIS.md`:
- **NSG2065Q** stock is tight on LCSC (~225 units); FD6288Q-compatible clones available as drop-in
- **INA186A3IDCKR** stock critical; INA199A2 is a possible fallback (26V common-mode — tight at 6S)
